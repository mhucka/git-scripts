## Introduction

This is a collection of git-oriented shell scripts I wrote or copied over the years. Nothing special, and for all I know, the functionality implemented here is available in other utilities.


## Installation

Copy the scripts from the [`src`](src) subdirectory somewhere that's on your shell `$PATH`.
